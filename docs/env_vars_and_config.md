# Using Environmental Variables for Ilios Configuration Settings

If you are familiar with versions of Ilios prior to v3.56.0, you have probably already noticed that there is no longer a `parameters.yml` file for managing the configuration settings of an Ilios instance, including its database connection settings and credentials.  As of Ilios v3.56.0, the parameters.yml file has been removed in favor of storing these values in the database or, where that is not possible (eg, database settings and credentials), setting the configuration variables as 'Runtime Environment Variables' within the context of the user that runs your web service processes on the system (typically 'apache', 'www', 'nginx', etc) instead.

Currently, almost all of the configuration settings for Ilios are stored within the `application_config` table of the Ilios database, except as noted below. The values listed here must be set in the local user's environment for initial installation and when running console commands on the command line and, for the actual web-server processes, these variables must also be set in the context of the user/daemon that runs the web services while the services are running (eg, `apache`, etc).

Before attempting to install or update an Ilios instance, please make sure the following values are set and present in your user's system environment as well as the system environment of the user that runs the web services on your system:

```bash
# the APP_ENV is very important!
APP_ENV=prod

ILIOS_LOCALE=en

ILIOS_DATABASE_URL=mysql://db_user:SomeVeryDifficultPassword@fqdn.database.hostname.edu:3306/ilios_database_name?serverVersion=8.0

#Set the authentication: "form", "ldap", "shibboleth", or "cas"
ILIOS_AUTHENTICATION_TYPE=form

ILIOS_DATABASE_MYSQL_VERSION=5.7

ILIOS_SECRET=SomeVeryRandomAlphaNumericStringUsedForEncryption

#For storing learning materials locally
ILIOS_FILE_SYSTEM_PATH=/var/www/ilios/learning_materials
#OR for storing them as Amazon S3 objects
#ILIOS_STORAGE_S3_URL="s3://AMAZON_AWS_ID:AMAZON_AWS_SECRET@amazon.s3.bucketname.region"

ILIOS_SEARCH_HOSTS=https://fqdn.searchhost.edu:443

#default mail service for sending mails directly from Ilios (local smtpd server or relay required)
MAILER_DSN=smtp://localhost:25

# This value is required for doctrine and should not be removed
MESSENGER_TRANSPORT_DSN="doctrine://default"
```

To see which environment variables are set for your respective user, you can run the `env` command like so:
```bash
env
```
When you run this command, all of your current environment variables will be displayed and will look something like the following:

```bash
HOSTNAME=ilios-web.example.com
TERM=xterm-color
SHELL=/bin/bash
PWD=/var/www/ilios
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
PS1=[\e[0;33m\]\u\[\e[0m\]@\[\e[31m\]\h\[\e[39m\]:\w]\n$
CLICOLOR=1
LSCOLORS=ExFxCxDxBxegedabagacad
HISTSIZE=1000
MAIL=/var/spool/mail/ilios_user
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/home/ilios_user/.local/bin:/home/ilios_user/bin
HOME=/home/ilios_user
MAILER_DSN=smtp://ilios_mail_user:Passw0rd@smtp-relay.example.com:25
ILIOS_AUTHENTICATION_TYPE=form
ILIOS_FILE_SYSTEM_STORAGE_PATH=/var/www/files/learning_materials
ILIOS_DATABASE_URL=mysql://ilios_user:ili0s_passw0rd@database.example.com/ilios_db?serverVersion=8.0
ILIOS_LOCALE=en
ILIOS_SECRET=ThisTokenIsNotSoSecretChangeIt
APP_ENV=prod
```

You'll want to verify that the `APP_ENV` variable is set (typically to `prod`) and that the other variables shown above, prefixed by `ILIOS_`, are also present.

# Setting ENV vars

## Setting Environment Variables for each Command-Line User

Setting the ENV variables for a given user on a system is typically a pretty straight-forward process and, for installation and maintenance of Ilios using console commands, you would just need to set the required ENV variables directly on the command-line, in a script at runtime, or have them already set upon login by declaring them in one of the respective user's initialization scripts (eg, .bashrc, .bash_profile`, `.profile`, etc.).

You can set these runtime variables in one of 3 ways:

#### Example #1 - Setting ENV vars upon login by exporting them using a user-initialization script
```bash
# Export these vars directly from within your preferred user initialization script (.bash_profile, .bashrc, .profile) and 
# they will be set and ready to be used upon login to the terminal and throughout the entirety of your user session

export APP_ENV=prod
export MAILER_DSN=smtp://ilios_mail_user:Passw0rd@smtp-relay.example.com:25
export ILIOS_AUTHENTICATION_TYPE=form
export ILIOS_FILE_SYSTEM_STORAGE_PATH=/var/www/files/learning_materials
export ILIOS_DATABASE_URL=mysql://ilios_user:ili0s_passw0rd@database.example.com/ilios_db?serverVersion=8.0
export ILIOS_LOCALE=en
export ILIOS_SECRET=ThisTokenIsNotSoSecretChangeIt
```
Doing it this way ensures that these ENV vars will always be available to your user while you work and/or run commands directly from the command line.

#### Example #2 - Setting ENV vars at the top of a shell script that runs the desired console command

Let's say that you are going to run the `/bin/setup` command to install a completely new version of Ilios.  For this approach, you would create a shell script that runs `bin/setup` as its final step, and set the ENV vars above it in the file, like so:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# set the environment variables
ILIOS_APP_DIR=/var/www/ilios
APP_ENV=prod
MAILER_DSN=smtp://ilios_mail_user:Passw0rd@smtp-relay.example.com:25
ILIOS_AUTHENTICATION_TYPE=form
ILIOS_FILE_SYSTEM_STORAGE_PATH=/var/www/files/learning_materials
ILIOS_DATABASE_URL=mysql://ilios_user:ili0s_passw0rd@database.example.com/ilios_db?serverVersion=8.0
ILIOS_LOCALE=en
ILIOS_SECRET=ThisTokenIsNotSoSecretChangeIt

#run the setup command
$ILIOS_APP_DIR/bin/setup
```

Note that doing it this way will only set the ENV variables for the duration of the execution of the `bin/setup` command and you will need to create/update a script like this for each command-line command you want to run.

#### Example #3 - Setting ENV vars at the command line directly

While it is technically possible to set all of the ENV vars at the command line on the same line when you run the `bin/setup` command, we do not recommend this approach.  However, if you choose to do so, it would look something like this:

```bash
APP_ENV=prod MAILER_DSN=smtp://ilios_mail_user:Passw0rd@smtp-relay.example.com:25 ILIOS_AUTHENTICATION_TYPE=form ILIOS_FILE_SYSTEM_STORAGE_PATH=/var/www/files/learning_materials ILIOS_DATABASE_URL=mysql://ilios_user:ili0s_passw0rd@database.example.com/ilios_db?serverVersion=8.0 ILIOS_LOCALE=en ILIOS_SECRET=ThisTokenIsNotSoSecretChangeIt bin/setup
```
Furthermore, as was the case in Example #2, the ENV vars set in this way only persist for the duration of the execution of the command being run.
  
## Setting Environment Variables for the Web-Services user

The user running the web server processes on your system will most likely NOT have an environment with a typical login shell like `BASH` or `csh`, so setting the ENV vars cannot be done with the usual method (eg, prefixing the command with `APP_ENV=prod ILIOS_SECRET='SomethingSecret'` vars at the command line). In these cases, the web service user's ENV variable values need to be set in the web server configuration directly (eg, within the `httpd.conf` file on Apache) or within the web service user's initialization script (eg, `/etc/sysconfig/httpd` or `/etc/apache/envvars`, depending on your flavor of Linux).

#### Option #1: Setting Web Service ENV vars via Web Service User Initialization Scripts (Apache httpd)

By populating one of these web service user-specific initialization scripts with the ENV vars in the same way as shown for a shell script (see Example #2 above), the variables will be accessible by the web daemon/service while the service remains running.  For example, on a RHEL system (RedHat, CentOS, or Fedora), we would populate the `/etc/sysconfig/http` file with following content:

```
APP_ENV=prod
MAILER_DSN=smtp://ilios_mail_user:Passw0rd@smtp-relay.example.com:25
ILIOS_AUTHENTICATION_TYPE=form
ILIOS_FILE_SYSTEM_STORAGE_PATH=/var/www/files/learning_materials
ILIOS_DATABASE_URL=mysql://ilios_user:ili0s_passw0rd@database.example.com/ilios_db?serverVersion=8.0
ILIOS_LOCALE=en
ILIOS_SECRET=ThisTokenIsNotSoSecretChangeIt
``` 

#### Option #2: Setting Web Service ENV vars via the Web Service Configuration Files (Apache httpd)

In order to set runtime environment variables within the Apache httpd web service configuration itself, you will need to enable the `mod_env` Apache module and set the `SetEnv` directives in the appropriate section(s) of your httpd configuration files as shown:

```
SetEnv ILIOS_DATABASE_URL mysql://ilios_db_user:Pa$$w0rd@db-host1/ilios_db?serverVersion=8.0
SetEnv ILIOS_DATABASE_PORT 3306
SetEnv MAILER_DSN=smtp://ilios_mail_user:Passw0rd@smtp-relay.example.com:25
SetEnv ILIOS_LOCALE en
SetEnv ILIOS_SECRET ThisTokenIsNotSoSecretChangeIt
```

#### Multiple Ilios instances on single Apache httpd server:
If you are running more than one Ilios instance (eg, production and staging instances) on a single Apache httpd server using multiple VirtualHost configurations, certain variables will collide (eg, `ILIOS_DATABASE_URL`), so these will need to be set conditionally.  In order to do this, you will need to install/enable the `mod_setenvif` Apache module and set the 'SetEnvIf' directives in the appropriate section(s) of your httpd configuration files as shown.  Note that the values shared between the two instances are set using `SetEnv`, while the conditional values are set with `SetEnvIf` and require a specific condition to be true in order to be set.  

```
SetEnv MAILER_DSN=smtp://ilios_mail_user:Passw0rd@smtp-relay.example.com:25
SetEnv ILIOS_LOCALE en

SetEnvIf Host "ilios-staging\.example\.com" ILIOS_DATABASE_URL=SetEnv ILIOS_DATABASE_URL mysql://ilios_staging_db_user:Stag1ngPassw0rd@db-host1/ilios_stage_db?serverVersion=8.0
SetEnvIf Host "ilios-staging\.example\.com ILIOS_SECRET=ST@G1nGS3CRET12345

SetEnvIf Host "ilios-production\.example\.com" ILIOS_DATABASE_URL=mysql://ilios_production_db_user:Pr0duct10nPassw0rd@/db-host1/ilios_production_db?serverVersion=8.0
SetEnvIf Host "ilios-production\.example\.com ILIOS_SECRET=PR0DUCT10nS3CRET12345
```

For more information on Apache Environments, `SetEnv`, and `SetEnvIf`, please refer to the Apache 2.4.x documentation at https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/env.html

## Verifying your Environment Variables

#### Verifying the user Environment at the Command Line

If you would like to verify that you have set all of the ENV variables required to install Ilios or use its command-line tools, you can run the following console command to do and Ilios-readiness health check (example shown being run in the context of the `apache` command-line user):

```bash
sudo -u apache bin/console monitor:list
```

If you are missing anything, the output will let you know by returning a message with the missing items and/or system that are incorrectly configured, like this:

```bash
FAIL ENV variables:
Missing:
ILIOS_DATABASE_URL
MAILER_DSN
ILIOS_LOCALE
ILIOS_SECRET
 For help see:
 https://github.com/ilios/ilios/blob/master/docs/env_vars_and_config.md
OK Default Timezone: Default timezone is UTC
OK Extension Loaded: apcu,mbstring,ldap,xml,dom,mysqlnd,pdo,zip,json,zlib,ctype,iconv extensions are loaded.
OK Dir Readable: The path is a readable directory.
FAIL Dir Writable: /var/www/ilios/var/cache/prod directory is not writable.
OK Security Advisory: There are currently no security advisories for packages specified in /var/www/ilios/src/../composer.lock
OK PHP version ">=" "7.2": Current PHP version is 7.2.10
```

If your setup is ready for Ilios to be installed, the health check console command should return an output message like this:

```bash
OK ENV variables: All required ENV variables are setup
OK Default Timezone: Default timezone is UTC
OK Extension Loaded: apcu,mbstring,ldap,xml,dom,mysqlnd,pdo,zip,json,zlib,ctype,iconv extensions are loaded.
OK Dir Readable: The path is a readable directory.
OK Dir Writable: The path is a writable directory.
OK Security Advisory: There are currently no security advisories for packages specified in /var/www/ilios/src/../composer.lock
OK PHP version ">=" "7.2": Current PHP version is 7.2.10
```

If you would like to verify ALL of the ENV variables for yourself or a different user on command line, and not just the ENV vars needed for Ilios, you can run the following commands:

```bash
# for yourself
env
```

```bash
# to check command line ENV vars for a different user:
sudo -u [USER_NAME] env
```

#### Verifying the Environment on the Web Server
To verify that the web-service user has all of the required ENV vars set for your Ilios instance, you can launch the Ilios health check by visiting the health-check URL of your Ilios system in your browser by going to https://[YOUR ILIOS FQDN]/ilios/health

If all of the settings are correct, all of the boxes of the 'System Health Status' grid shown at the top page should be displayed in green as shown here:

![ilios_system_health_status_all_green.png](images/ilios_system_health_status_all_green.png)

If you would like to verify/review all of the ENV vars are set for within your web service, and not just those necessary for running Ilios, create a php file on your webserver with the following content and then view the file in your browser:

```php
<?php
phpinfo();
```

For Apache-based web servers, the currently-set Environment Variables should appear under the 'Apache Environment' or 'Environment' sections of the output.  If they are not set, you need to set them via one of the appropriate configurations as described above.

#### Setting ENV vars globally and concurrently (command-line AND web-services users)

Regardless of how you plan to use Ilios, we know that you will be working with it heavily at both the command line, for scheduled 'cron' jobs and maintenance tasks, AND as a web-service, for hosting the application GUI.  We also know that maintaining multiple environments for each use-case (command line users vs. web-service) can be a hassle, especially when the ENV values would typically be the same between the two and could effectively be shared.  

Unfortunately, there is no easy "standard" solution for sharing the ENV variables between command-line use-cases and the web service, so we've come up with a bit of a workaround for accomplishing this and we thought we'd mention it here. While this isn't necessarily a recommendation or a "best practice" per sé, we have had some success in keeping all of our required ENV vars in-sync between our command-line `apache` user and the `apache` user running our web service by using the following method:

On RHEL systems (Redhat, CentOS, and Fedora), an init file exists at `/etc/environment` for populating environment variables for every command-line user. Upon login, it adds its environment settings in addition to those set by the users' individual init scripts. To keep the ENV var settings in-sync between the apache web-service and any logged-in command-line user, we do the following:

We populate the `apache` web service user's init script at `/etc/sysconfig/httpd` with following content:

```bash
APP_ENV=prod
MAILER_DSN=smtp://smtp-relay.example.com:25
ILIOS_AUTHENTICATION_TYPE=form
ILIOS_FILE_SYSTEM_STORAGE_PATH=/var/www/files/learning_materials
ILIOS_DATABASE_URL=mysql://ilios_user:ili0s_passw0rd@database.example.com/ilios_db?serverVersion=8.0
ILIOS_LOCALE=en
ILIOS_SECRET=ThisTokenIsNotSoSecretChangeIt
```

And then we delete the global `/etc/environment` init script, and recreate it as a symbolic link pointing to the `/etc/sysconfig/httpd` web service init script with the following command(s):

```bash
sudo rm /etc/environment && sudo ln -s /etc/sysconfig/httpd /etc/environment
```

The idea behind this is that EVERYONE who logs in to the system will have the properly-configured ENV settings that match those set for the apache httpd web service user by having the two init scripts point to the exact same file.  One file ensures the settings will ALWAYS be in-sync. If you'd like to try this, but are confused, or if you can come up with a better way for managing this file-synchronicity, please do not hesitate to contact us at support@iliosproject.org with any questions or suggestions!

## Why Environment Variables?

Many users have asked why we have decided to deprecate/remove the `parameters.yml` file for ENV vars and there are several reasons that are best summed up by the makers of the Symfony framework in their [Symfony 3.2 release notes](https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-3-2-runtime-environment-variables), from when they first introduced the change themselves:

>[Configuration Options set as Runtime ENV variables] are one of the main concepts of the [twelve-factor app methodology](https://12factor.net/). Their main advantages are that they can be changed between deploys without changing any code and that they don't need to be checked into the code repository.
