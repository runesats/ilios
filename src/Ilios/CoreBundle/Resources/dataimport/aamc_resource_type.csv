1,Audience Response System,"An electronic communication system that allows groups of people to vote on a topic or answer a question. Each person has a remote control (“clicker”) with which selections can be made; Typically, the results are instantly made available to the participants via a graph displayed on the projector."
2,Audio,"Devices or applications used to acquire or transfer knowledge, attitudes, or skills through study, instruction, or experience using auditory delivery"
3,Cadaver,"A human body preserved post-mortem and “used...to study anatomy, identify disease sites, determine causes of death, and provide tissue to repair a defect in a living human being”"
4,Clinical Correction,"The application and elaboration of concepts introduced in lecture, reading assignments, independent study, and other learning activities to real patient or case scenarios in order to promote knowledge retrieval in similar clinical situations at a later time"
5,Distance Learning - Asynchronous,"Education facilitated through communications media (often electronic), with little or no classroom or other face-to-face contact between learners and teachers, and which “does not occur in real time or involve simultaneous interaction on the part of participants. It is intermittent and generally characterized by a significant time delay or interval between sending and receiving or responding to messages”"
6,Distance Learning - Synchronous,"Education facilitated through communications media (often electronic), with little or no classroom or other face-to-face contact between learners and teachers, “in real time, characterized by concurrent exchanges between participants. Interaction is simultaneous without a meaningful time delay between sending a message and receiving or responding to it. Occurs in electronic (e.g., interactive videoconferencing) and non-electronic environments (e.g., telephone conversations)”"
7,Educational Technology,"Mobile or desktop technology (hardware or software) used for instruction/learning through audiovisual (A/V), multimedia, web-based, or online modalities (Group on Information Resources, 2011); Sometimes includes dedicated space"
8,Electronic Health/Medical Record (EHR/EMR),"An individual patient's medical record in digital format...usually accessed on a computer, often over a network…[M]ay be made up of electronic medical records (EMRs) from many locations and/or sources. An Electronic Medical Record (EMR) may be an inpatient or outpatient medical record in digital format that may or may not be linked to or part of a larger EHR"
9,Film/Video,"Devices or applications used to acquire or transfer knowledge, attitudes, or skills through study, instruction, or experience using visual recordings"
10,Key Feature,"An element specific to a clinical case or problem that demands the use of particular clinical skills in order to achieve the problem's successful resolution; Typically presented as written exam questions, as in the Canadian Qualifying Examination in Medicine"
11,Mannequin,"A life-size model of the human body that mimics various anatomical functions to teach skills and procedures in health education; may be low-fidelity (having limited or no electronic inputs) or high-fidelity (connected to a computer that allows the robot to respond dynamically to user input)"
12,Plastinated Specimens,"Organic material preserved by replacing water and fat in tissue with silicone, resulting in “anatomical specimens [that] are safer to use, more pleasant to use, and are much more durable and have a much longer shelf life”"
13,Printed Materials (or Digital Equivalent),"Reference materials produced or selected by faculty to augment course teaching and learning"
14,Real Patient,"An actual clinical patient"
15,Searchable Electronic Database,"A collection of information organized in such a way that a computer program can quickly select desired pieces of data"
16,Standardized/Simulated Patient (SP),"Individual trained to portray a patient with a specific condition in a realistic, standardized and repeatable way (where portrayal/presentation varies based only on learner performance)"
17,Task Trainer,"A physical model that simulates a subset of physiologic function to include normal and abnormal anatomy; Such models which provide just the key elements of the task or skill being learned"
18,Virtual Patient,"An interactive computer simulation of real-life clinical scenarios for the purpose of medical training, education, or assessment"
19,Virtual/Computerized Laboratory,"A practical learning environment in which technology- and computer-based simulations allow learners to engage in computer-assisted instruction while being able to ask and answer questions and also engage in discussion of content; also, to learn through experience by performing medical tasks, especially high-risk ones, in a safe environment"
20,Wet Laboratory,"Facilities outfitted with specialized equipment* and bench space or adjustable, flexible desktop space for working with solutions or biological materials"
